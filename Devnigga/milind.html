      To write HTML ( Hypertext Markup Language ) code, start by making a new file with a .html extension.

      Did you noticed when we usually make a file and save it, the file automatically get saved with an extension, 

      now what is an extension? An extension is a suffix at the end of a filename that indicates what type of file it is.

Hence, we have made a file named milind.html
